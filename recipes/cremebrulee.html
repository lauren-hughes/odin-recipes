        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy/light cream</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <!--

            -->
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> tsp salt</li>
            <li>5 egg yolks</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup granulated sugar (plus more for topping)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 163&deg;C (conventional).
            <li>In a saucepan, combine cream and salt. Cook over low heat just until hot. Let sit for a few minutes, then add vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>
                In a bowl, beat yolks and sugar together until light. Stir about a quarter of the vanilla cream into this mixture, then pour the sugar-egg mixture 
                into the cream and stir. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the combined mixture into four 6-ounce ramekins and place the ramekins in a baking dish. Fill the dish with boiling water halfway up the sides 
                of the ramekins.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the centres are barely set. Cool them completely and refrigerate for several hours and up to a couple of 
                days.
            </li>
            <li>
                When ready to serve, top each custard with about a teaspoon of sugar in a thin layer. Place the ramekins in a broiler 5 to 7.5 cm from the heat 
                source. Turn on the broiler and cook until the sugar melts and browns (about 5 minutes). Serve within 2 hours.
