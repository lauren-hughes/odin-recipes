            <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>125 g sour cream</li>
            <li>300 g caster sugar</li>
            <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>3 large eggs (room temperature)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Strawberries</li>
            <li>Blueberries</li>
            <li>Raspberries</li>
            <li>Icing sugar (for dusting)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 160&deg;C (140&deg;C fan).
            <li>
                Get a 20 cm springform cake tin. Turn the base upside down, butter lightly and place a square piece of parchment/baking paper on the base and clip 
                into the springform pan. Excess paper will stick out. Butter and line the side of the pan.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Biscuit Base</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Break up biscuits roughly by hand and place in a food processor. Blitz until fine crumbs. Add butter and briefly blitz until dispersed and it 
                resembles wet sand.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour into the prepared cake tin. Use a spatula to roughly spread it out over the base and up the walls. Use something with a flat base and vertical 
                edges (I used a measuring cup) to press the crumbs up the wall almost to the top of the sides, and flatten the base.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a mixer or beater to beat the cream cheese until smooth (about 30 seconds on medium high).</li>
            <li>
                Add flour and beat until just combined (10 seconds). Add vanilla, sour cream, sugar and lemon zest. Beat until just combined (10-15 seconds). Add 
                eggs one at a time, beating between until just combined (10 seconds each). Don't over beat, we don't want to aerate the batter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour into prepared crust and bake for 55 minutes. The top should be a very light golden brown, not cracked, and near perfectly flat. It should 
                jiggle slightly when you gently shake the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Cool in the oven with the door open then refrigerate for at least 4 hours in the pan.</li>
            <li>Remove the springform pan sides and use the overhanging paper to slide the cheesecake off the cake pan, then slide the cheesecake off the paper.</li>
            <li>Top with berries and dust with icing sugar.</li>
        </ol>
