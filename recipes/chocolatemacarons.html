            <!-- 
                <sup> is for superscript, <sub> is for subscript and &frasl; is for a diagonal fraction slash
                Together they create a formatted fraction in HTML

            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> tsp cream of tartar</li>
            <li>28 g granulated sugar</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chocolate Ganache</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>57 g heavy cream</li>
            <li>71 g chocolate (semisweet, milk or dark)</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> tsp salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Chocolate Macarons</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 146&deg;C (convection) and line a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> baking sheet with a macaron template and baking paper.</li>
            <li>Sift together the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, salt, and almond flour, twice if not blended.</li>
            <li>Pulse the mixture in a food processor 8-10 times to make the almond flour mixture even finer and texture and to blend the ingredients together.</li>
            <li>Whip the egg whites on low to frothy consistency and slowly add the sugar in thirds.</li>
            <li>
                Once the egg whites turn white and you can see some lines forming in the surface from the whisk, add cream of tartar, whipping on medium until 
                soft glossy peaks form.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the vanilla to the meringue during the soft peak stage, then continue whipping on medium-high until you get stiff peaks that start gathering 
                and bunching on the inside of the whisk.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of your almond mixture to the meringue. Fold your spatula under the batter and around the edges and then cut 
                through the center until the almond flour is mixed in. Continue with the rest of the almond flour, folding until homogenous.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gently press the spatula on top of the batter while you turn the bowl to take out some fo the air from the meringue. Continue folding around the 
                outside edge until the batter forms a ribbon and moves like lava. Your meringue is ready when it forms a ribbon off the spatula and the batter that 
                settles almost dissolves all the way back into the rest of the batter but still leave a bit of a line. 
            </li>
            <li>Pipe small rounds onto the lined baking sheet about 2.5 cm in diameter (use a macaron template as a guide).</li>
            <li>
                Drop the pan onto the table 5-6 times from about 13 cm above the table to release bubbles. Use a toothpick to remove big pockets of air trapped 
                under the surface. Use a very small amount of water on your fingertip to smooth any rough spots.
            </li>
            <li>Allow to dry uncovered until a crust forms on the surface (about 30 minutes to 2 hours).</li>
            <li>
                Bake at 146&deg;C (convection) for about 14-15 minutes or until lightly browned. If not quite brown baked, bake for an additional 1 minute. 
                Cooled cookies should pull away from the parchment paper without sticking. If they do stick, they were not baked enough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let cool fully before removing from the parchment and filling with ganache. Cookies can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. 
                Shells can be frozen for 6 months in an airtight container.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Chocolate Ganache</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place all the ingredients into a heatproof bowl and microwave for one minute. Let sit for 5 minutes then whisk until smooth. Heat for another 
                15 seconds if not fully melted. Place into the fridge for 20 minutes then whisk until smooth. It should be the texture of peanut butter.
            </li>
        </ol>
