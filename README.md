# odin-recipes
This project was created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). It contains three formatted recipes (contained in the recipe directory), which each include an image, description, ingredients and steps. Each of these recipes can be navigated to via the index page and the index page can be retured to by clicking the Odin Recipes logo in the banner. The project utilises HTML and CSS, and ultimately serves as a brief demonstration of some HTML and CSS skills.
